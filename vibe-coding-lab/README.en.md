# Vibe Coding Lab

## Lab Overview

"Vibe Coding" is a way of completing programming tasks through natural language communication with an AI assistant. In this lab, you will experience how to develop a simple application from scratch by having a conversational dialogue with Amazon Q CLI.

## Lab Objectives

- Experience the process of application development through conversational dialogue
- Learn how to effectively describe requirements and issues to an AI assistant
- Master how to quickly complete application development through iterative feedback
- Understand how to apply Amazon Q CLI in real development scenarios

## Lab Tasks

In this lab, you will collaborate with Amazon Q CLI to develop a simple HTML calculator application that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

### Step 1: Launch Amazon Q CLI

Open a terminal and start Amazon Q CLI:

```bash
q chat
```

### Step 2: Present Initial Requirements

Present your initial requirements to Amazon Q CLI:

```
Please help me develop a simple HTML page that implements a calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
```

### Step 3: Iterative Development

1. Review the code generated by Amazon Q CLI
2. Save the code to a file (e.g., `calculator.html`)
3. Open the file in a browser to test the functionality
4. If you find issues or have new requirements, continue the conversation with Amazon Q CLI
5. Repeat the above steps until the application meets your requirements

Example conversations:
- "There's an issue with the calculation results; decimal calculations are not accurate"
- "Can you add a clear button?"
- "The interface looks too simple; can you make it more visually appealing?"

### Step 4: Complete the Application

The lab is complete when the application meets the following conditions:
- Can correctly perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Has a user-friendly interface with intuitive operation
- Has no obvious functional errors

## Lab Summary

After completing the lab, consider the following questions:
- What are the advantages of conversational development with Amazon Q CLI?
- Which expressions are more effective when describing requirements and issues?
- How can this development approach be integrated into your daily workflow?

## Extension Challenges

If you have completed the basic tasks, you can try the following extensions:
- Add more advanced functions (such as square root, exponentiation, etc.)
- Add a calculation history feature
- Implement responsive design so the calculator displays well on different devices
- Add keyboard support to allow users to input using the keyboard
